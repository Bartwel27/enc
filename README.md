# enc
This script provides a simple encryption and decryption tool for text. It can encrypt readable characters into unreadable characters, and vice versa. This can be useful for secure communication, as only those with the decryption key can read the encrypted text. The script uses a substitution cipher, replacing each character with a corresponding encrypted character. To encrypt a string, simply input the text and the script will output the encrypted version. To decrypt, input the encrypted text and the script will output the original readable text

###### E.G
encrypted:
```
=[??:#-:@?Ã—
```

```
hello world
```
